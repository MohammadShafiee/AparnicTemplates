##How can I make another template##

It is very simple, Just create a folder in ```Plugin/AparnicTemplates/webroot/css/``` directory, specify it's name in this format ```theme_{NUM}```, for example ```theme_2```,
 And then create your style.css file.
Create style_rtl.css too, If you want to support Right to Left.
To add it in the AparnicTemplate setting, see ```View/Templates/admin_setting.ctp```
